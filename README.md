# SpeakOut at WorkPlace

## Project Summary

The SpeakOut at WorkPlace project is a software application designed to facilitate the reporting of assault incidents within companies worldwide. The system aims to initiate a restoration process for employees who have been victims of abuse by enabling them to report incidents to their city's government. The software features a secure system for receiving, analyzing, and processing reports, along with mechanisms for providing guidance, protection, and support services to victims. It also includes options for legal recourse where necessary.

### Workflow Overview

1. **Reporting**: Employees report abuse incidents through the government's central portal specific to their city.
   
2. **Case Management**: A volunteer from the government assesses each case, redirects it to relevant entities, and ensures timely resolution according to established protocols.

3. **Support Services**: Victims receive appropriate assistance:
   - Medical care for physical or mental health issues.
   - Counseling or psychiatric services based on their needs.
   - Legal support for unlawful situations.

4. **Follow-up and Monitoring**: Volunteers track case progress, provide ongoing support, and ensure victims are in a safe environment post-resolution. Detailed logs of interactions and case updates are maintained.
