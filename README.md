                                                        Project Name: #SpeakOut at WorkPlace

Project Summary:
Designed software application for reporting assault at any company(s) in the any part of the world, that can initiate a restoration process for employees who have been victims of atrocities through reporting to the government of the city. The software consists of a secure system for receiving and analyzing reports, as well as mechanisms for providing guidance and protection to those affected by the abuse. The software can take appropriate steps to mitigate them, while also offering support services and options for legal recourse where necessary.
Firstly, the case reporter will report the case to the government central’s portal with respect to each city and then a volunteer from the territory’s government would be assigned to the case; he or she would then examine the case and redirect it to the necessary entities. The volunteer would also ensure that the case was addressed in a timely manner and in accordance with established protocols. Additionally, the volunteer would monitor the progress of the case and provide ongoing feedback to those involved in its resolution.
Employees who faced any type of abuse would be sent to doctors; those who faced mental/physical, or any type of assault would be sent to a counsellor or psychiatrist depending on their state of need. In the case of any unlawful situation, the case would be sent to lawyer. The volunteer would also be responsible for providing the necessary resources to help the employee in their situation, such as access to medical care or legal advice. They would also be responsible for following up with the employee after the resolution of the case, to ensure they are in a healthy and safe environment. They would be expected to keep a detailed log of their interactions with the victim, to document any progress or issues. Additionally, they would be required to contact the relevant authorities, such as the police or other government agencies, if necessary.
